This technical documentation provides an overview of the functions used in the Project Description Image Generation Bot. This bot allows users to create project descriptions and generate images based on these descriptions.

1. Getting Started
The Project Description Image Generation Bot is built on the Telegram platform.
To run the bot, you will need the following keys and tokens: BOT_TOKEN, OPEN_AI_KEY, and DEEPAI_TOKEN, which should be specified in the config.py file.
The bot requires Python and the following libraries: aiogram, aiohttp, requests, and openai.
2. Bot Structure
The bot consists of the following components:

image_generate: An asynchronous function for generating images based on project descriptions using the DeepAI API.

UserData: A class for storing user data, such as project descriptions and keywords.

Message Handlers:

/start: Initiates interaction with the bot. Users are prompted to provide a brief project description.
Inputting a project description and keywords triggers the generation of an image based on this input.
3. Usage
Here's how the bot works:

A user starts a chat with the bot and sends the /start command.
The bot prompts the user to briefly describe the project.
Once the user provides a project description, the bot prompts them to enter keywords they'd like to see in the generated post.
The bot combines the project description and keywords into a content prompt.
It then uses the OpenAI ChatCompletion model (gpt-3.5-turbo) to generate a text description for the project concept.
This generated text is sent to the DeepAI API to generate an image corresponding to the project concept.
The bot sends the generated image back to the user.
4. Error Handling
If there are any errors in the process, such as a failure to generate an image, the bot informs the user accordingly.
5. Further Enhancements
You can further enhance this bot by adding features like image customization options, error handling improvements, and better user instructions.
